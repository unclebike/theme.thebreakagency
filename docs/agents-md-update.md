# AGENTS.md Update

<!-- anchor: agents-md-creation -->

## What Was Done
- Improved existing AGENTS.md file from 43 lines to ~20 lines for conciseness
- Consolidated redundant sections while preserving essential information
- Maintained all critical build commands and code style guidelines

## Files Touched
- `/Users/admin/Sites/snook/AGENTS.md` - Streamlined content, merged related sections
- `/Users/admin/Sites/snook/docs/ANCHOR_MANIFEST.md` - Created new documentation structure

## Key Implementation Decisions
- Preserved all build commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `gulp`)
- Maintained Ghost theme specific guidelines (Handlebars syntax, asset references)
- Kept CSS custom properties and GSAP/ScrollTrigger requirements
- Consolidated file organization and naming conventions into fewer lines
- Created docs directory structure for future anchor-based documentation

## How It Connects
- AGENTS.md serves as primary reference for agentic coding agents
- Documentation structure now supports anchor protocol for future updates
- Maintains compatibility with existing Ghost theme development workflow
